        I chose the Astra theme because of its reviews as a highly customizable option and the amount of 
        downloads it has means it must be user friendly as well. It describes itself as sort of a one-size-fits-all 
        theme. It also claims it provides expert support for free users. I chose WP Super Cache because it improves 
        a site's speed by creating and serving static HTML versions of pages, instead of generating them dynamically.
